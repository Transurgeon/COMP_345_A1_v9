### Problem statement
* This is a team assignment. It is divided into distinct parts. Each part is about the development of a part of the topic presented as the team project. 
* Even though it is about the development of a part of your team project, each assignment is to be developed/presented/tested separately. 
* The description of each part describes what are the features that the part should implement, and what you should demonstrate. 
* Note that the following descriptions describe the baseline of the assignment, and are related to the project description.
* See the course web page for a full description of the team project, as well as links to the details of the game rules to be implemented.

#### Assignment 1: 
* Specific design requirements
  1. All data members of user-defined class type must be of **pointer type**.
  2. All file names and the content of the files must be according to what is given in the description below.
  3. All different parts must be implemented in their own separate .cpp/.h file duo. All functions’ implementation must be provided in the .cpp file 
    (i.e. no inline functions are allowed).
  4. All classes must implement a correct copy constructor, assignment operator, and stream insertion operator.
  5. **Memory leaks must be avoided**.
  6. Code must be documented using comments (user-defined classes, methods, free functions, operators).
  7. If you use third-party libraries that are not available in the labs and require setup/installation, you may not assume to have help using them 
     and you are entirely responsible for their proper installation for grading purposes.

#### 5 Parts to be implemented
 **Part 1 : Map**
 Implement a group of C++ classes that implement the structure and operation of a map for the game Warzone 
(https://www.warzone.com/). The map must be implemented as a connected graph, where each node represents 
a territory. Edges between nodes represent adjacency between territories. Each territory can have any number of 
adjacent territories. Continents must also be connected subgraphs, where each territory belongs to one and only 
one continent. Each territory is owned by a player and contain a number of armies. The Map class can be used to 
represent any map configuration. The map objects should be created by loading a map file in the .map text file 
format as found in the “Domination” game source files, available at: 
http://domination.sourceforge.net/getmaps.shtml using a MapLoader class. The map loader must be able to read 
any map file available on the above-mentioned web page. The map loader should store the map as a Map object
as described above. The map loader should be able to read any text file (even ones that do not constitute a valid 
map). 
All the classes/functions that you implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named 
Map.cpp/Map.h. You must deliver a file named MapDriver.cpp file that contains a main function that 
successively creates a maps by reading a set of domination map files and successfully creates a map object for 
valid map files, and rejects invalid map files of different kinds. After a map object has been successfully created, 
the driver should demonstrate that the Map class implements the following verifications: 1) the map is a connected 
graph, 2) continents are connected subgraphs, and 3) each country belongs to one and only one continent.

*  **Map Class : Map.h, Map.cpp, MapDriver.cpp**                                                                            
    - The **Map class** is implemented as a **connected graph**. The graph’s nodes represents a territory (implemented as a **Territory class**). 
    - Edges between nodes represent adjacency between territories.
    - Continents are connected subgraphs. Each territory belongs to one and only one continent.                                                         
    - A **territory** is owned by a player and contain a number of armies.                                      
    - The **Map** class can be used to represent any map graph configuration.                                      
    - The Map class includes a **validate()** method that makes the following checks: 
        1 the map is a connected graph,
        2 continents are connected subgraphs and
        3 each country belongs to one and only one continent.
    - Map loader can read any Domination map file
    - Map loader creates a map object as a graph data structure.
    - Map loader should be able to read any text file (even invalid ones).
    - Driver that reads many different map files, creates a Map object for valid files and rejects the invalid ones. 
    
 **Part 2 : Player**
Implement a group of C++ classes that implement a Warzone player using the following design: A player owns a 
collection of territories (see Part 1). A player owns a hand of Cards (see Part 5). A player has their own list of 
orders to be created and executed in the current turn (see Part 3). A player must implement the following 
methods, which are eventually going to get called when decisions have to be made: The player should contain a 
method named toDefend() that return a list of territories that are to be defended, as well as a method named 
toAttack() that returns a list of territories that are to be attacked. For now, all that these methods should do is to 
establish an arbitrary list of territories to be defended, and an arbitrary list of territories that are to be attacked. 
The class must also have a issueOrder() method that creates an Order object and puts it in the player’s list of 
orders. The classes/functions that you implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo 
named Player.cpp/Player.h. You must deliver a file named PlayerDriver.cpp file that creates player objects and demonstrates that the player objects indeed have the above-mentioned features. 
*  **Player Class : Player.h, Player.cpp, PlayerDriver.cpp**                                                                            
    - Player owns a collection of territories (see Part 1)
    - Player owns a hand of Warzone cards (see Part 5)
    - Player contains methods toDefend() and toAttack() that return a list of territories that are to be defended and to be attacked, respectively. 
    - Player contains a issueOrder() method that creates an order object and adds it to the list of orders. 
    - Driver creates players and demonstrates that the above features are available.
    
  **Part 3 : Orders List**
Implement a group of C++ classes that implement a Warzone player orders using the following design: Orders are 
created by the player during their turn and placed into the player’s list of orders. By default, each order is placed 
in the list sequentially. After orders are put in the list, the player can move them around in the list (using the 
move() method) or delete them (using the remove() method). The different kinds of orders are: deploy, advance, 
bomb, blockade, airlift, and negotiate. All orders must have a validate() method that verifies if the order is valid.
All orders must have an execute() method that will result in some game action being implemented (see the 
project description document). Note that the orders’ actions do not need to be implemented at this point. Invalid 
orders can be created and put in the list, but their execution will not result in any action. All the classes/functions 
that you implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named 
Orders.cpp/Orders.h. You must deliver a file named OrdersDriver.cpp file that contains a main function that 
creates a list of orders and demonstrates that the OrdersList implemented according to the following specifications:
*  **Orders Class : Orders.h, Orders.cpp, OrdersDriver.cpp**                                                                            
    - The OrdersList class contains a list of Order objects.
    - Each kind of order is implemented as a subclass of the Order class. 
    - The Order class implements a stream insertion operator that outputs a string describing the order. If the order has been executed, it should also output the effect of the order, stored as a string. 
    - Every order subclass must implement the validate() method that is used to validate if the order is valid.
    - Every order subclass must implement the execute() method that first validates the order, and executes its action if it is valid, according to the order’s meaning and the player’s state.
    - The OrdersList class implements a remove() method that deletes an order from the list.
    - The OrdersList class implements a move() method to move an order in the list of orders. 
    - Driver that creates orders of every kind, places them in an OrdersList object, and demonstrates that the above features are available. 

  **Part 4 : Cards deck/hand**
Implement a group of C++ classes that implements a deck and hand of Warzone cards. Each card has a type 
from: bomb, reinforcement, blockade, airlift and diplomacy. The Deck class must have a draw() method that 
allows a player to draw a card at random from the cards remaining in the deck and place it in their hand of cards.
The objects of type Card must have a play() method that is called to play the card, which creates an order and 
adds it to the player’s list of orders and then returns the card to the deck. All the classes/functions that you 
implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named Cards.cpp/Cards.h. You must 
deliver a file named CardsDriver.cpp file that creates a deck of Warzone cards. The driver must also create a 
hand object that is filled by drawing cards from the deck.
*  **Cards Class : Cards.h, Cards.cpp, CardsDriver.cpp**                                                                            
    - A Deck object contains a finite collection of Warzone cards.
    - A Hand object is a finite collection of Warzone cards. 
    - Each card has a type from: bomb, reinforcement, blockade, airlift, and diplomacy.
    - Deck has a draw() method that allows a player to draw a card at random from the cards remaining in the deck and place it in their hand
    - Each card has a play() method that enables a player to use it during game play by creating special orders. Once a card has been played, it is removed from the hand and put back into the deck.
    - Driver that creates a deck of cards of all different kinds, then creates a hand object that is filled by drawing cards from the deck, then calls the play method of all cards in the hand. 

  **Part 5 : Game Engine**
Implement a group of C++ classes that implements a game engine that controls the flow of the game by using the 
notion of state, transition, and command. The state represents a certain phase of the game and dictates what are 
the valid actions or user commands that take place in this phase. Some actions or commands may eventually 
trigger a transition to another state, which is what controls the flow of the game. All the classes/functions that you 
implement for this component must all reside in a single .cpp/.h file duo named 
GameEngine.cpp/GameEngine.h. You must deliver a file named GameEngineDriver.cpp file that allows the user 
to type commands on the console, whose result is to trigger some state transitions as depicted in the state 
transition diagram presented below. Any command that does not correspond to an outgoing edge to the current state should be rejected. 
*  **GameEngine Class : GameEngine.h, GameEngine.cpp, GameEngineDriver.cpp**                                                                            
    - User enters commands on the program console, specified on the edges of the above graph.
    - Control flow uses states as specified on the above graph. 
    - The correct commands trigger state transitions, as specified on the above graph.
    - Incorrect commands result in an error message displayed on the console and do not result in a state transition. 
    - Driver that creates a console-driven interface that allows the user to navigate through all the states by typing commands as stated in the above graph.
